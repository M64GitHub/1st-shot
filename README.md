## **Next-Level Terminal Bullet Hell**

*Authentic Commodore 64 SID music. Subpixel-smooth sprite animation. Explosions and bonus points. All in your terminal.*

---

This isn't your typical ASCII roguelike. **1st-shot** pushes terminal gaming into uncharted territory with technology that rivals modern GUI games:

### **Authentic SID Chip Music**
The **world's first terminal game** with real Commodore 64 SID chip emulation, running in a dedicated background thread. Experience the iconic sounds of the C64 era while you dodge bullets.

### **Real-Time Audio Mixing**
Dynamic WAV sound effects seamlessly mixed into the SID music stream. Explosions, weapons, power-ups — all with zero audio interruption or glitches.

### **Subpixel-Smooth Motion**
Forget choppy ASCII movement. A custom subpixel accumulator system allows sprites to move at fractional pixel speeds, creating smooth motion at any velocity. Each sprite glides pixel-by-pixel with precise sub-frame positioning.

### **Three Enemy Types with Distinct Behaviors**
Different enemy patterns with formation flying, state machines, and targeting:
- **SingleEnemy**: Straight or zigzag patterns with global wave sync
- **SwarmEnemy**: Snake-like formations that grow over time (up to 17 sprites!)
- **ShooterEnemy**: State machine behavior with projectile tracking and orphaned bullet mechanics - beware, it aims at You!

### **True Sprite Graphics**
PNG sprite sheets with frame-based animation, not ASCII art. Object pooling prevents allocation overhead. Buffered rendering eliminates flicker.

### **Multi-Threaded Architecture**
Audio runs in its own thread, updating every 35ms independently of the game loop. No audio stutter, no frame drops.

### **Complete Game Engine**
- **3 explosion types**
- **200-star parallax starfield** with depth-based speed
- **Multiple weapon systems** (spread shot, default)
- **Shield mechanics** with visual overlays
- **Score-based progression** with auto-unlocking rewards
- **12-state game state machine** (pause, death, respawn, game over)

## How to Play

### Survive the onslaught!

**Destroy enemies and asteroids** to earn points. **Collect power-ups** to upgrade your ship. **Avoid collision** or use shields to survive.

### Enemy Types

#### **SingleEnemy** (250 pts)
- Simple but deadly
- Two movement patterns: Straight or Zigzag
- Unlocked from start
- Health: 5 hits

#### **SwarmEnemy** (500 pts)
- Snake-like formations
- Grows longer the longer you survive (up to 17 segments!)
- Graduated amplitude creates mesmerizing wave patterns
- Unlocks at **1000 frames (~16 seconds)**
- Health: 15 hits (hit the head!)

#### **ShooterEnemy** (350 pts)
- Advanced AI with state machine
- Fires two tracking projectiles at your position
- **Danger**: When destroyed, attached bullets become orphans and fall!
- Unlocks at **2000 frames (~33 seconds)**
- Health: 3 hits (shoot the bullets for instant kill!)

### Power-Ups

- **Ammo**: Refills spread weapon
- **Shield**: Temporary invincibility
- **Extra Life**: Gain 1 life
- **Score Bonus**: Instant points

### Dropstacles

Shoot these to collect rewards (but don't touch them!):
- **ShieldDrop** (25%)
- **LifeDrop** (20%)
- **AmmoDrop** (40%)
- **Jackpot** (5%): Shield + Life + 100 Ammo!

They all look the same, the actual reward will be a surprise.

### Score Milestones

Reach these scores to auto-unlock bonuses:
- **3,000**: Ammo bonus
- **5,000**: Shield bonus
- **10,000**: Extra life

## Technical Deep Dive

### How It Works

**1st-shot** combines several techniques to create a smooth terminal gaming experience:

#### **Subpixel Movement Algorithm**

Traditional terminal games move objects 1 cell at a time. We use a **fractional accumulator**:

This allows speeds like **0.33 pixels/frame**, creating smooth motion impossible with frame-based movement.

#### **SID Chip Emulation Integration**

Using the **zigreSID** library, we emulate the legendary MOS Technology 6581/8580 SID chip:

The `MixingDumpPlayer` wraps SID emulation + WAV mixing:
- Reads SID register dumps (`.dmp` format)
- Emulates authentic C64 sound synthesis
- Mixes WAV samples in real-time when effects trigger

#### **Sprite Pooling**

Pre-allocate sprite pools at startup, never allocate during gameplay:

Benefits:
- Zero allocation overhead during gameplay
- Predictable memory usage
- No garbage collection pauses
- `get()` / `release()` pattern for instant reuse

#### **Multi-Threaded Audio**

Game loop: **~180 FPS** (~5600μs per frame including rendering and output)
Audio thread: **~28 FPS** (35ms update interval)

Runs independently, preventing audio glitches during heavy rendering.

#### **Manager Pattern Architecture**

Each game system is a dedicated manager:
- `EnemyManager` - Enemy behaviors and spawning
- `ObstacleManager` - Asteroid field
- `WeaponManager` - Player weapons
- `SoundManager` - Audio (optional, graceful degradation)
- `ExplosionManager` - Spawns as many as required, also delayed
- ... and 9 more!

Clean separation of concerns, easy to extend.

## Development

### Architecture Highlights

**Flicker-Free Rendering:**
```zig
while (true) {
    inner_loop += 1;
    poll_input();  // Every loop (responsive)

    if (inner_loop % 100 == 0) {
        update_game_state();
        render_everything();
        screen.output();  // Single output = no flicker
    } else {
        sleep(50μs);  // Fast polling
    }
}
```

**State Machine:**
- FadeIn → StartingInvincible → AlmostVulnerable → Playing
- Death loop: Dying → Respawning → FadeIn
- Pause transitions with fade effects
- Game over on lives == 0

**Collision Detection:**
- Inset-based AABB (adjustable hitboxes)
- Asymmetric insets for player ship (forgiving bottom, tight top)
- Props have negative inset (easier to collect)

### Adding New Enemies

1. Create enemy struct with state
2. Implement `update()` and collision methods
3. Add sprite pool to `EnemyManager`
4. Register in spawn system with unlock frame
5. Add collision detection in `GameManager`
6. Trigger sounds on destruction

### Adding Sound Effects

1. Add WAV file to `assets/audio/`
2. Add enum variant to `SoundEffectType`
3. Load in `SoundManager.init()`
4. Call `triggerSound()` at event locations

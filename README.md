Next-Level Terminal Bullet Hell â€” powered by [movy](https://github.com/M64GitHub/movy)  

> **1ST-SHOT** is my first attempt at building a visually rich, animated game inside the terminal â€” powered entirely by my rendering engine "movy".  
> After [**Zigtoberfest 2025**](https://www.youtube.com/@zigtoberfest), I wanted to make this version public so others can **play with it, study it, and modify it**.  
> Itâ€™s not a finished game â€” it's a *playable demo and learning project*: a smooth main loop, sub-pixel motion, sprite animations, explosions, and SID-style sound with wav mix support â€” all written in pure Zig.  
> I built it to show that the terminal can still surprise us â€” and shine through pixels.  
> (See the [Release Notes](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) for more background.)

### What makes 1ST-SHOT special:

- Renders PNG sprites in 24-bit color, slicing animations from spritesheets
- Implements subpixel movement for smooth motion
- Generates authentic C64 SID music on a dedicated audio thread, mixing PCM in real time

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- **Zig 0.14.1**
- **SDL2** (for audio)
- Terminal with 24-bit color support (most modern terminals)

### Install

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/M64GitHub/1st-shot.git
cd 1st-shot

# Build (optimized for ReleaseFast)
zig build

# Run the game
zig build run-1st-shot
```

*Note: Dependencies (movy and zigreSID) are automatically fetched during build via Zig's dependency manager.*

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Arrow Keys** | Move ship left / right |
| **Space** | Fire weapon |
| **P** / **Up**| Pause / Unpause |
| **ESC** | Quit |

## How to Play

### Survive the onslaught!

**Destroy enemies and asteroids** to earn points. **Collect power-ups** to upgrade your ship. **Avoid collision** to survive.

### Enemy Types

#### **SingleEnemy** (250 pts)
- Simple but deadly
- Two movement patterns: Straight or Zigzag
- Unlocked from start
- Health: 5 hits

#### **SwarmEnemy** (500 pts)
- Snake-like formations
- Grows longer the longer you survive (up to 17 segments!)
- Graduated amplitude creates mesmerizing wave patterns
- Unlocks at **1000 frames (~16 seconds)**
- Health: 15 hits (hit the head!)

#### **ShooterEnemy** (350 pts)
- Simple "intelligence" with state machine
- Fires two tracking projectiles at your position
- **Danger**: When destroyed, attached bullets become orphans and fall!
- Unlocks at **2000 frames (~33 seconds)**
- Health: 3 hits (shoot the bullets for instant kill!)

### Power-Ups

- **Ammo**: Refills spread weapon
- **Shield**: Temporary invincibility
- **Extra Life**: Gain 1 life
- **Score Bonus**: Instant points

### Dropstacles

The blue round objects. Shoot these to collect rewards (but don't touch them!):
- **ShieldDrop** (25%)
- **LifeDrop** (20%)
- **AmmoDrop** (40%)
- **Jackpot** (5%): Shield + Life + 100 Ammo!

They all look the same, the actual reward will be a surprise.  
(numbers in brackets are the chance for the reward type)
